1. When started, the load the page in a new tab.


2. Read and memorize item ID of items 1 through 8 onto "LIST A", and items 9 and 10 onto "LIST B"


3. Wait X seconds and refresh.
   After refreshing, compare the list of the first 8 items on the page to "LIST A":
   
      a) If lists are equal, continue refreshing (back to stage 3.)
   OR
      b) If lists are NOT equal, then:


           4. Determine what is the first different item that is not contained in "LIST A" 
              Then check if this item is equal to any item on "LIST B":
                 
                   a) If not, then immediately focus on tab + play alert sound + restart the script in a new tab (back to stage 1.)
                OR
                   b) If yes, then re-memorize both lists from scratch (back to stage 2.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Based on this logic, whenever new items are added, the script should behave in the following ways:

Case 1) When any item disappears from the first 8 items and therefore any of the older items are pushed back in line,
        the script will overwrite lists A and B from scratch, and continue refreshing as it would normally

Case 2) When any new item, that is different from those contained in lists A and B, appears anywhere in the first 8 items,
        the script will focus on current tab, play alert sound and restart the script in a new tab

Case 3) When any new item appears and another existing item disappears on the same refresh, the script will always trigger Case 2 
        because it will always detect the new item first, since any old item will always be in the later position 
        relative to the new item because it is pushed in from the back


REFRESH:

extension must have custom refresh rate setting, making the script wait X seconds before refreshing again

ideally the script should refresh the items on the page by "clicking" on "1" at the bottom of the page (preferably without having to scroll down)
otherwise the "Extraordinary" button at the bottom of the filter tab to the left may be used to do the same

the countdown to next refresh must start after the baron logo "Updating Offers" disappears and the updated items have been read and compared

if there is a better way to trigger a refresh, let me know


ERRORS:

sometimes the page gets stuck loading
sometimes the page shows gateway error
sometimes any open tab will automatically change to https://skinbaron.de/en/maintenance and display a maintenance message

in any case of slowdown or any error or failing to load results, the script should wait for 10 seconds
before reloading the whole page and attempting to continue working
if this timeout happens 5 times in a row, stop the script


OTHER:

extension must have custom link setting that I can set
extension must have start and stop buttons for running the script
script should reset whenever I close Firefox, and must always be started manually

script must be fast, clean and efficient, it's very important that it does it's job as fast and efficiently as possible

if you have any questions or suggestions let me know
